# ðŸ‘» kvba-scp
kvba-scp is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project under a website [scp.kuba.lol](https://scp.kuba.lol) (as of time of writing) about SCP anomalies and it's entries. There's not much here but enough for a start.

Bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

##  ðŸ”§ Development

Project uses `pnpm` package manager to manage dependencies so for full support you need to install `pnpm` (`npm i -g pnpm`). To run the development server use:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.  
If you have any suggestions or pull request, I'm open for all of them.  
All the code is available under `src` directory.
